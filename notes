Vaolight is an independent artist out of the San Francisco Bay Area specializing in positive music. As a vegan artist he is motivated by his love for the enviornment and animals. After being shot in 2012 and recovering a year later, Vaolight is making his best music yet, the majority of which has yet to be released! So stay tuned! Writing theme songs, jingles, advertisements, as well as full songs from a wide variety of genres is well within Vaolight's comfort zone. (rap, hop hop, rock, country,etc) Please reach out if there is a project you would like hand taylored for your needs, and we will do our best work to provide you with something of value to cherish. Thanks for reading!
